## About

Solitary Dungeon was created for the sole purpose of being a practical method of learning the basis of Object Oriented Programing and Game Design. The Project will be updated as changes are made that affect the usefulness or scope of the game.

**However, my true ultimate goal is to produce a community-developed proceduraly generated survival game in a similar style to Dwarf Fortress or RimWorld!**

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this project by modifying/adding to the program code or various creative assets, read the [Best Practices for Contributing] below and feel free to follow the standard Github workflow:

1. Fork the project.

2. Clone your fork to your computer.
 * From the command line: `git clone https://github.com/SirUniverse/SolitaryDungeon.git`
3. Change into your new project folder.
 * From the command line: `cd ProjectPorcupine`
4. Create a branch for your new feature.
 * From the command line: `git checkout -b my-feature-branch-name`
5. Make your changes.
 * Avoid making changes to more files than necessary for your feature (i.e. refrain from combining your "real" pull request with incidental bug fixes). This will simplify the merging process and make your changes clearer.
6. Commit your changes. From the command line:
 * `git add Assets/my-changed-file.cs`
 * `git add Assets/my-other-changed-file.cs`
 * `git commit -m "A descriptive commit message"`
7. While you were working some other pull request might have gone in the breaks your stuff or vice versa. This can be a *merge conflict* but also conflicting game logic or code. Before you test, merge with master.
 * `git fetch upstream`
 * `git merge upstream/master`
8. Test. Start the game and do something related to your feature/fix.

9. Push the branch, uploading it to Github.
  * `git push origin my-feature-branch-name`
10. Make a "Pull Request" from your branch here on Github.
  * Include screenshots demonstrating your change if applicable.
